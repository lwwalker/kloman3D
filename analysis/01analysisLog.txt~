Step 1 - Process raw titer data to binary response vector.  In principle continuous response would be interesting, however the bulk of titers are either > 50 or <10 presenting a picture of data in a bimodal distribution.

(1/23/13) - process raw data for "knowns" b12, 2F5, 447-52D
`../code/makeResp.py ../rawData/b12.txt ../rawData/b12.fas b12.resp`
found 127 titer values, of which 61 are sensitive

`../code/makeResp.py ../rawData/2F5.txt ../rawData/2F5.fas 2F5.resp`
found 126 titer values, of which 87 are sensitive

`../code/makeResp.py ../rawData/447-52D.txt ../rawData/447-52D.fas 447.resp`
Titer Value of >12.5 found for EBFBR93019, scoring as resistant
Titer Value of >12.5 found for EDUG93070, scoring as resistant
found 88 titer values, of which 14 are sensitive
Note: a little unclear what to do with ">12.5", because it probably means they didn't check concentrations higher. Given strong bimodal signature of data, by "eyeball imputation", the conditional probablilty of being > 50 if you're greater than 12.5 is high.

Note: spot-check of these values against 2010 work consistent.
